> Primo is an open-source design system that makes it easy to build high quality 
> and accessible web applications. The system includes designs, token, styles 
> and components built using modern JavaScript.

Currently under a lot of work in progress üöÄ

## The Repository

This repository is where the Primo design system is maintained. This is a
working design system aimed to support frontend experiences and a
commonplace to find visual styles, components and patterns.

## Getting started

If you're just looking to get started with tokens and a base style reset,
checkout `@primo/styles` and `@primo/tokens`. For a full
bundle with React components and fonts, look at `@primo/react`.

For a full bundle with React components and fonts, look at
[`@primo/react`](./packages/react) or
[`@primo/styles`](./packages/styles). These will provide the building
blocks in `react` and `css`.

In the future we will look to support

- Angular
- Vue
- Web Components (Stencil JS)
