> Primo is an open-source design system that makes it easy to build high quality 
> and accessible web applications. The system includes designs, token, styles 
> and components built using modern JavaScript.

Currently under a lot of work in progress üöÄ

## The Repository

This repository is where the Primo design system is maintained. This is a
working design system aimed to support frontend experiences and a
commonplace to find visual styles, components and patterns.

## Getting started

If you're just looking to get started with tokens and a base style reset,
checkout `@primo/styles` and `@primo/tokens`. For a full
bundle with React components and fonts, look at `@primo/react`.

For a full bundle with React components and fonts, look at
[`@primo/react`](./packages/react) or
[`@primo/styles`](./packages/styles). These will provide the building
blocks in `react` and `css`.

### Requirements

This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). Ensure you are using version `1.2.55` for yarn, to install please follow the [installation guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

For node make sure you've set you local to version `16.*.*`. Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your local development versions.

### Installation

To get started we need to setup all our local dependencies, we're using yarn workspaces and lerna to manage our mono repo.

```sh
yarn
```

In the future we will look to support

- Angular
- Vue
- Web Components (Stencil JS)
