# @primo/components

> Component styles for the Primo Design System

## Getting started

To install `@primo/components` to your new or exsisting project, you will
need to run the following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @primo/components
```

If you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command instead:

```bash
yarn add @primo/components
```

This package requires [Dart Sass](http://npmjs.com/package/sass) in order to
compile.

If you're new to Sass, or are wondering how to configure Sass for your project,
we recommend checking out the following resources and links:

- [Sass Basics](https://sass-lang.com/guide)
- [Webpack with Sass](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/sass-loader/)
- [Next.js with Sass](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support)
- [Create React App with Sass](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet/)
- [Parcel with Sass](https://v2.parceljs.org/languages/sass/)
- [Vite with Sass](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css-pre-processors)
- [Snowpack with Sass](https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/sass/)

Once you get Sass up and running in your project, make sure to configure Sass to
include `node_modules` in its `includePaths` option.
